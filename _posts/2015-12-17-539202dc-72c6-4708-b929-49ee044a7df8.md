> Tomorrow will be the past and today will be yesterday. Every day we strive for perfection, and the hour is upon us to perfect our craft. But tomorrow is another day and when it comes we will behold the future, the past will reflect our will to acheive all that we desire. Yesterday we remembered our mistakes of today, and today we forgot about tomorrow, tomorrow we will undo our future by mistaking our past to be today.
